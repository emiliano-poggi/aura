## Overview
A.U.R.A. (Artificial Ubiquitous Reality Analysis) is a research technological framework designed to study how narrative structures, cognitive patterns, and models of reality emerge from interactions between humans Stream of Consciousness (SoC) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

This repository serves as the **primary reference hub** for the project. It contains:

- The foundational [AUR vision document](./vision.md).
- A minimal en-to-end working [AURA prototype](./prototype.md).
- The implementation-oriented [AURA architecture document](./architecture.md).

## Stream of Consciousness and A.U.R.A.
A.U.R.A. explores the Stream of Consciousness technique as a controlled stress-test environment for investigating:

- How LLMs **infer latent structure** when the text provides minimal explicit cues  
- How a model constructs **implicit narratives or world models** from fragmented mental flows  
- How humans and artificial agents differ in resolving ambiguity or overfitting incomplete information  
- Whether meaning can be *detected*, *constructed*, or *hallucinated* under SoC constraints  
- The boundary between **interpretation** and **imposed structure** when analyzing non-narrative text  

Two experimental paradigms guide these investigations:

1. **Structured SoC**  
   - Texts intentionally hide an underlying narrative logic.  
   - A.U.R.A. tests whether LLMs can recover or approximate the hidden structure.  

2. **Unstructured SoC**  
   - Texts contain no underlying narrative or intended semantic coherence.  
   - A.U.R.A. evaluates whether LLMs invent structure, how they do so, and what this reveals about model biases.

These paradigms aim to clarify how artificial systems construct “reality” when provided with incomplete, noisy, or purely interior monologue data.

## Purpose
A.U.R.A. supports research across:

- Computational narrative theory  
- Cognitive modeling  
- Artificial interpretation and bias analysis  
- Extreme-text understanding (non-linear, opaque, or ambiguous data)  
- Automated multi-model reasoning  
- Transparent, reproducible AI–human co-analysis
