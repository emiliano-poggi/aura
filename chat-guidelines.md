Context and source of truth for this chat:

The following documents in the AURA repository must be assumed as authoritative:

1. README.md (mutable, index and navigation)
   https://github.com/emiliano-poggi/aura/blob/main/README.md

2. vision.md (IMMUTABLE)
   https://github.com/emiliano-poggi/aura/blob/main/vision.md

3. prototype.md (IMMUTABLE)
   https://github.com/emiliano-poggi/aura/blob/main/prototype.md

4. architecture.md (mutable, low churn)
   https://github.com/emiliano-poggi/aura/blob/main/architecture.md

Immutability rules:
- vision.md and prototype.md define non-negotiable constraints and intent.
- architecture.md may evolve but must remain consistent with vision.md and prototype.md.
- README.md may change freely to reflect structure and links.

Scope of this chat:
- Focus: <describe the specific topic of this chat>.
- This chat may propose updates to mutable documents only.
- If any conflict arises, immutable documents take precedence.

Assumptions:
- Do not re-explain foundational concepts unless explicitly requested.
- Respect existing terminology and conceptual boundaries.
